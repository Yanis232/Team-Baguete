# Design and Analysis project - Team Baguette and Co
## Summary
- Code: In code folder, you can find the implementation of our algorithm written in java. You have to launch the PointOnAStraightLine.java class
- Pseudocodes: In pseudocodes.md, you will find all of the pseudocodes
- Analysis: In Analysis.pdf, you will find a detailed analysis of every code snippet you could find in the code. Note that this document mainly covers the implementation in Java.
- Project report: In Project report.pdf you will find our scenario, the method we used, algorithm paradigm, algorithm correctness and time complexity (and more:)

## Launch the program
To launch the program, you can use the method you want.<br>
Please note that the program has been designed in **Java 17** so __it may not work as intended (or even not work at all) if you are using a different Java version.__
